# Kargo_Summer_Intern_Pre-assessment

### Question: Determine whether a one-to-one character mapping exists from one string, s1 to another string s2.

### `For example:` 

<b>test_case_1</b>: Given ​s1 = abc​ and ​s2 = bcd,​ print `true` into stdout​ since we can map each character in "abc" to a character in "bcd".

<b>test_case_2</b>: Given ​s1 = foo​ and ​s2 = bar,​ print `false`​ since the character ‘o’ cannot map to two characters.

<b>test_case_3</b>: But given ​s1 = bar a​ nd ​s2 = foo​, print `true`​ since each character in "bar" can be mapped to a character in "foo."

### `Outcome:`
